#### This is a wordpress plugin I developed for vintageoaksrealty.com. 

It is a word spinner that interacted with several tables in the DB to create automatic custom housing descriptions. 
The plugin ran when new homes were added to the site creating a customized description. 

"This spacious 4/3/3 Monticello home..."
